In question 1, I try to solve the diamond problem using interfaces and while it doesn't prompt any error, I cannot treat the All-rounder class like a normal child class from which I can Initalize the parent class values, in this case it is the Bowler class and Batsman class. So the All-rounder class is no different than an independent class in this case, however the print calls are working respective to the type of object it was created from, so this one way of solving the diamond problem using java interfaces.

In question 2, It is just a simple java implementation of classes based on the question.
